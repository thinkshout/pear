<h2> About We Care for p:ear Summer Campaign</h2>
<p>This summer an amazing partnership between p:ear students and ThinkShout interns developed. p:ear is local non profit whose mission is to mentor homeless youth through education, art and recreation.

    Just a few blocks away lives ThinkShout, a tech company dedicated to delivering open source solutions to non profits and forward thinking companies, whose three summer interns worked hard to launch the “We Care for p:ear Summer T-Shirt Campaign.”

    This campaign was created to allow ThinkShout’s interns the opportunity to work on a project that would benefit a local nonprofit and in return p:ear will receive all of the profit made from the campaign. Through this campaign some of p:ear’s most creative students got the opportunity to design one of the t-shirts featured below.

<h1> About p:ear</h1>

<p>During the ages 15 through 24 people go through some of the most important development stages. For students who don’t have support whether it be in school or outside of the classroom p:ear is there to help.

    P:ear is a local nonprofit dedicated to supporting and mentoring homeless youth through creative education practices. Their creative approach allows students to find their interests and become passionate about subjects without the strict guidelines of the education system.

    One of p:ear’s primary missions is to provide a safe space for students. Allowing students a place to relax and sit comfortably without the fear of judgement, sounds like a very basic service, but it is one of the most important things they provide.

    P:ear has been offering their services and love to homeless youth in Portland for the last 15 years. By participating in our campaign, you could improve a p:ear students day on their journey to tomorrow. Read more about p:ear below.
