            <p>Here at ThinkShout we believe in creating lasting partnerships with nonprofits and forward thinking companies. Participating in our campaign is more than just buying a t-shirt. All of your money will go directly to p:ear, to fund programs like their Bike Mechanic and Barista schools which will help students learn lifelong skills and have a chance for more equal opportunities. But your money does more than just fund programs, $28 can buy three students breakfast and dinner and $25 can help with the cost of bus tickets and a pair of socks, journals and pens, sketchbook and pastels, first aid kits and even a hoodie.</p>

            <p>For students who don’t have support whether it be in school or outside of the classroom p:ear is there to help.</p>
            <p>p:ear is a local nonprofit dedicated to supporting and mentoring homeless youth between the ages 15 and 24 through creative educational practices. Their approach allows students to find their interests and become passionate about subjects without the strict guidelines of the education system. Through this campaign some of p:ears most creative students came together and designed one of the t-shirts featured above.</p>
            <p>One of p:ear’s primary missions is to provide a safe space for students and they have been offering their services and love to homeless youth in Portland for the last 15 years.</p>
            <p>By participating in our campaign, you could improve a p:ear students day on their journey to tomorrow. Read more about p:ear.</p>
